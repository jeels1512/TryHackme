**DNS**

**"nslookup" is the command that is helpful to get the IP addresses of example.com any website.**

**When we want to know the information about any domain, like tryhackme.com, there is a command called whois.
By this command, we can get all the information about that particular entity, such as registering a domain name, 
including name, phone number, email, and address.**
